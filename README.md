- `Speaker Diarization` : Different speakers are identified in the audio and labelled accordingly in the transcript.
- `Edit text after recording` : The generated transcript can be edited to correct spelling or grammatical errors, or to add some text before saving it.
- `Text summarization` : A summary of the transcript is also generated for longer audios.
- `Calendar integration` : In-built calendar to save important dates and reminders.
- `Save the notes` : Store the text in a txt file for future reference.
- `Load a saved note` : Load a previously saved file along with its summary within the app itself.
